All pull requests must adhere to the following rules before they can be merged into the main branch:

1. **Review Process**:
   - Every pull request must be reviewed by at least two developers.
   - Reviewers should check for code quality, adherence to coding standards, and proper testing.

2. **Approval**:
   - The pull request can only be merged once it has received two approvals from the reviewers.
   - Any requested changes must be addressed before the pull request can be approved.

3. **Merging**:
   - After receiving the necessary approvals, the author of the pull request or a designated maintainer may merge the pull request into the main branch.
